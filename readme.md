# Basic Deepfake Generation using HeyGen

## Project Description

This project documents the process of creating a basic deepfake video by following the steps outlined in a specific video tutorial and utilizing the **HeyGen** platform. The core activity involved uploading a self-recorded video to HeyGen to generate an "instant avatar," thereby creating a deepfake representation.

The primary goal was to gain a practical, hands-on understanding of how deepfake technology works, exploring both its operational mechanics and its inherent capabilities and limitations. This direct interaction with deepfake creation tools provides valuable insights into the technology's accessibility and the quality of the resulting output, fostering a more informed perspective.

## Purpose

* To gain firsthand experience with accessible deepfake creation tools like HeyGen.
* To understand the fundamental steps involved in generating a basic deepfake video from input footage.
* To observe the relationship between the input video and the quality/realism of the generated deepfake output.
* To evaluate the ease-of-use and accessibility of current online deepfake generation platforms.
* To develop a more informed perspective on the potential applications, ethical considerations, and limitations surrounding deepfake technology.

## Features Demonstrated / Key Activities

* Generation of a basic deepfake video using a personal input video.
* Utilization of HeyGen's "instant avatar" creation feature.
* Practical application of steps learned from a video tutorial guide.
* Analysis of the resulting deepfake for quality and resemblance.

## Technologies Used

* **HeyGen:** Online AI video generation platform used for creating the deepfake avatar.
* **Video Recording Equipment/Software:** Standard tools (e.g., smartphone camera, webcam, screen recorder) used to capture the initial input video.
* **Video Tutorial:** The specific instructional guide followed for the deepfake creation process. *(Optional: Add a link or reference to the tutorial if possible/appropriate).*

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Tutorial Identification:** Selected and reviewed the video tutorial outlining the steps for deepfake generation using HeyGen.
2.  **Input Video Recording:** Recorded a short video clip (e.g., speaking to the camera) to serve as the source material for the deepfake.
3.  **Platform Access:** Accessed the HeyGen platform (potentially involving signup/login).
4.  **Video Upload:** Uploaded the recorded source video to the HeyGen platform.
5.  **Avatar Generation:** Followed the platform's workflow (specifically using the "instant avatar" feature) to process the uploaded video and generate the deepfake avatar/video.
6.  **Output Review & Analysis:** Examined the generated deepfake video, noting aspects like realism, lip-sync accuracy, artifacts, and overall effectiveness, comparing it to the original input.
